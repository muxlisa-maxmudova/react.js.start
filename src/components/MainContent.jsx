            <h1>Information about Lorem Ipsum</h1>
            <p>Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/ LOR-əm IP-səm) is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development to fill empty spaces in a layout that do not yet have content. <br/>

                Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, <br/> with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical <br/> and improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of dolorem ipsum.

                Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer <br/> sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world <br/> in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.</p>
